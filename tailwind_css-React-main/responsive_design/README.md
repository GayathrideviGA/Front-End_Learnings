# Responsive Design

## Using responsive utility variants to build adaptive user interfaces.

Every utility class in Tailwind can be applied conditionally at different breakpoints, which makes it a piece of cake to build complex responsive interfaces without ever leaving your HTML.

There are five breakpoints by default, inspired by common device resolutions:

- Breakpoint prefix Minimum width CSS

* sm 640px @media (min-width: 640px) { ... }
* md 768px @media (min-width: 768px) { ... }
* lg 1024px @media (min-width: 1024px) { ... }
* xl 1280px @media (min-width: 1280px) { ... }
* 2xl 1536px @media (min-width: 1536px) { ... }
